*  We will support cultural and other events done by the people and with 
an accent on community-related events, without unnecessary bureaucracy. 
As Pirates we value our monuments and cultural heritage. 
We want to renovate more and demolish less. *

### Culture by the people in public space
* **We will support arranging cultural and neighborhood-related events by the people**.
The bureaucracy necessary for taking a public space for a limited amount of time
will be simplified. Small community-related events will get our support. 
* **Public spaces will be cultivated by installments of works of art**.
The current sculptures and other works of art will be documented, listed and once
this is done, renovated and further maintained. 

### Transparent finance management for culture
* **Financial management of cultural institutions must be transparent**. We will make them
more independent on political structures, so that political parties will have
less power in them. 
* **Grant proposals should be submitted twice a year**. At least twice. We will
stop the distribution of grants outside of the grant terms. No more circumventions
of the grant committees by grant applicants should take place.

### Architecture and monument protection
* **Architecture and urbanism contests** must become a necessary standard for new
projects. The total cost of a project must not be the major criterion. 
* **Let's repair rather than demolish**. We will initiate a new urbanism-architectural
contest for the Výstaviště Exhibition Grounds area. We will also support the renovation
of the damaged wing of the Industrial Palace, the core of the area that was destroyed by
2008 fire.

### Healthy development of tourism
* **No more tourist traps**. We see these as a shame when we speak with our
foreign guests. We will bring end to the faux money exchanges, taxi drivers robbing tourists
and other people who exploit those who have little knowledge of our capital. 
* **But not only tourists live in the city center**. We will support the community
in the city center. This will mean limits for unwanted behavior of some of the tourists who
make it hard for locals to live in the city center or work there.
