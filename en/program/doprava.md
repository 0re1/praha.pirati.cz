  With better support for metro, tram and train service the city transport will be running more smoothly. We want the public transport to be more available, comfortable and well usable both for citizens of Prague as well as for the visitors of our capital. We will also provide better management of upcoming individual transport investments as well as the maintenance of relevant road infrastructure.

*With better support for metro, tram and train service the city transport will be running more smoothly. 
We want the public transport to be more available, comfortable and well usable both for 
citizens of Prague as well as for the visitors of our capital. We will also provide 
better management of upcoming individual transport investments as well as 
the maintenance of relevant road infrastructure.*

### Public transport more available. Better quality of service.
* **We support new tram tracks all over the city**. As our priorty we see the construction
of new tram tracks in the central part of the city. We will bring back the tram track to 
Václavské náměstí. We will also complete the tram ring around the city center. This will
not bring any reduction of the number of parking spaces,
* **New train tracks in the city must be completed sooner**. Connection from the 
airport to the city center as well as to the city of Kladno must be done as a priority. 
* **More options for public transport tickets. Price caps**. You will have a possibility
to buy a ticket with your credit card or a mobile app with no necessity to print a ticket
on paper. Like in London or Ostrava the ticket prices will be capped, so you won't pay
per day more than for a daily ticket! 
* **Longer trams will make it possible for more people to sit on their way.** Depending
on the possibilities of the current car park, we will prioritize longer trams over short 
ones. We will focus on availability of tram service, efficient use of the car park and 
proper procurement process for purchase of new trams. Current location data of all 
vehicles will be made public so passengers won't be waiting aimlessly for delayed 
or missing connections. 
* **Support for metro D line.**
Connecting the Prague 4 and Prague 12 districts is one of our priorities. The new metro
line won't be another installment of the Blanka tunnel blunder. 
* **The price for monthly ticket will be reduced to 400 CZK**. The price difference between
the monthly and yearly ticket represent a significant barrier for various groups
of citizens. Those who can't afford to pay several thousand CZK at once do have
more expensive fare now. 

### Better parking
* **We will make more parking spaces where people need them**
In various places there is a shortage of parking spaces for residents. This problem needs
its solution. 
* **More P+R parking spots for short-term and long-term use**. These parking places (both
in Prague and in Central Bohemia) must be well connected to the public transport network.
* **Simple parking. Simplier zoning.** The data on current usage of parking spaces will
be made public. This will allow everyone to make apps that can help drivers to find a free
parking space. 
* **Your visit and your plumber can park here**. Every resident will get certain number
of free hours that can be used for their visits in the area. No more expensive parking
or looking for a parking space for your plumber when he comes. 

### Investments in road infrastructure will continue
* **We will make completion of the inner city ring faster, as well as the connecting roads.**
The inner ring is a very important tool that helps to reduce the amount of individual transport
in the city center. Is should be completed and used. We will support the final variant that
will be chosen by a professional process that will include an analysis of gains and costs. In
relation to the completion of this inner ring we will make further analyses related to the 
quality of life in the city center. The ring should be used by public transport, including its 
tunnels. 
* **The outer ring road should be completed with the help of Pirate MPs.** Based on the analysis
of general impact on local people, transport safety, costs, completion dates etc. a final 
design of the missing parts of the outer ring road will be approved. The major goal is to 
bring transit truck traffic out from the city center. 
* **We will fix the internal infrastructural debt**. No more collapsed bridges. 
Infrastructure renovations will be planned so that no further gridlocking of
entire neigborhoods will take place. Instead of small and repeated renovations we will do them in
a bulk. 

### More modern and ecologic modes of transport
* **We will support reasonable introduction of electric traction**. This means more
electric buses and trolleybuses in areas where these will be economically justifiable.
We also support reasonably defined car sharing projects where electric cars will be 
in the pool. We will support construction of relevant infrastructure in parking houses.

### Cyclists represent our partners
* **We will propose construction of new bike roads that will allow safe and quick
travel for cyclists with no fear of an accident with a car**. These lanes must be equipped
with lamps so they could be used all year round. 
* **Bike stand project will be initiated and further cooperation will take place together
with bikesharing companies**. This will help to reduce the amount of bikes that are left
at sidewalks or other places where people walk and usually these bikes may represent a 
barrier. 
* **Where an old field path once stood a cycling trail will be built.** This will help 
to interconnect neighborhoods outside of the city center.
